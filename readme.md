## Afterlife Enterprise: Vision

The **Afterlife Enterprise™ (AE)** is an organization dedicated to developing the technology required for a civil future for humanity. The specific fields of R&D include neurological-imaging, neurological-simulation, and future-oriented economic modelling. The key technology that the efforts of teh Afterlife Enterprise revolve around is the simulation of the human brain, especially the actual (not laboratory-engineered) brains of actual humans. Among other things, this technology opens the gate to purely virtual and eternal life - an Afterlife™ in the Networld™ (virtual-real network-world).

## Introduction to Futurology

Throughout history, it has overwhelmingly been the case that in one's lifetime there is little to none political or economic change. Only in times of systemic fallout are there dramatic revolutions that effect more than relatively small groups in isolated ways.

Historians popularly designate huge periods of times to be single Ages. Protohistory is popularly segmented into the Stone, Iron, and Bronze Ages, which altogether lasted more than 3.4 million years, and ended with the development of writing and simple designed materials such as alloys. History began with this birth of writing in 3500 B.C.E, and progressed to include the Ancient Historical Ages (3500 B.C.E - 200 C.E), the Middle Ages (500 - 1400 C.E), and finally the Modern Ages (1500 C.E - present). Among the Modern Ages, we have the Machine, Atomic, Digital, Space, and finally information Ages in quick succession each much less than a century long.

A natural question arises. Why is it that it took us 3.4 million years the replace iron spearheads with bronze spearheads, but it has only us less than two hundered years to replace an [imaginary marble-powered adding machine](http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/) with [pocket-sized supercomputers](https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/). There are factors that answer this question, from the development of our brains during the course of our evolution to the changes in our environment to simply the fluctuation of the number of humans that exist all at the same time. But one factor is undeniably the main driver of modern and future development of the human race: technology.

This answer is hardly a suprise, but the rammifications are critical to realize fully. Several devepments in modern history have strictly reminded us of something special about technological progress reaching a cross-generation as it has in recent history - once important technology is invented there's no going back. The nuclear bomb is perhaps the clearest example of this. There will never again be a period in which there are no nuclear weapons and the reason is simple - everyone knows about nuclear weapons and no one is going to forget that they are possible. In ancient history there are many examples of great civilizations that rose magnificently into civilized organization but then fell dramatically into barbaric chaos. But since the beginning of the Modern Age, this particular pattern has been erraticated. Once we have nation-states, nation-states stay. Once we have oil power, oil power stays. Once we have automatic weapons, automatic weapons stay. Once we have artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence will stay.

As the Modern Age has progeressed, this rule has become more and more firm as costs continue to plummet. Two hundred years ago, assembling an explosive may have been possible for the average person to accomplish after some effort in educating themselves properly and collecting the required material, but today one can spend 5 minutes on YouTube and 10 minutes on Amazon and be fully prepared. According to this sort of trend, can we expect it high-power explosives to avaliable on a whim 100 years from now?

Many similar questions in this area of study arise that are critically important to our economic, political, and moral future. In order to prepare, engineers and scientists have been standardizing efforts to predict the future. Predicting the future traditionally has been a specialty of psuedoscience at best and fraud at worst, but there's no reason that it can merge with the academic sciences with due organization just as chemistry, astronomy, psychology, and all of the other sciences have (philosophy, or natural science, being the original science).

The study of the future is an inherently interdisciplinary field, in a similar way as political science, but is also importantly unique in the abstract. It focusses not only on drawing the results and methods of other fields into an application on currently trends and prediction, but also an eye for meta-analysis of results and methods that can build the study up itself in anticipation of technological and social developments. Think the [Second Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation) but before the development of the Empire and without psychohistorians in the supernatural sense.

The emerging field of Futurology is intertwined with AE's mission because AE plans not only to incorperate the tenants of Futurology into its business practices and R&D, but also its evolution over the course of the soon coming Ages of history.

## Projects

The following are the established foci of Afterlife Enterprise reasearch and development.

### Neurological Imaging

The first step to modelling the human brain, or any brain for that matter, is to accurately record real human brains. This effort has been pioneered by the [Human Connectome Project](http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org), which defined as **connectome** as not specifically the arrangement of all of the atoms in a brain but rather the arrangement of the nuerons in a sybolic manner. The theory is that recording one's connectome would completely describe one's brain state at a given instance of time.

The research's current stage is recording the connectome's of small and relatively simple minds (such as [worm brains](http://openworm.org)).

During this period, an adventurous and most-likely rich portion of the population will donate their brains to research in the name of science and also the chance that their neurological-records are reanimated once the following technologies are realized.

#### Technology

- Brain imaging cameras

### Neurological Simulation

Once sufficient imaging technology is avaliable, serious simulation efforts will shortly commence. Currently, attempted simulators are so innefficient that believably life-like virtual beings are far from the reality. However, as data processing, machine learning, and artifical intelligence are such hot topics in the tech world at the moment, it is inevitable that vastly more efficient and powerful data-procesing technology will be developed in the next few years.

Simulation will yield the first forms of truely living purely-virtual artificial life. With the simulations of simple-organisms yielded from the previously described neurological imaging data, it will be impossible to deny the authenticity of this breakthrough.

After a period of testing, full-scale simulations of organisms will be rampant. Namely, simulated humans (referred to as one's Afterlife™). There is no reason at the moment to believe that the first simulated humans will be extraordinary in any way. They will have the exact neurology of a previously-flesh-and-blood human, and the earliest tests will likely involve a great deal of lag on the part of the observer's experience. The simulatee will experience in a super-speed as simulation updates will lack the percieved continuity of our everyday sensations until a certain quality of simulation is reached. Once this threshold of simulation efficiency is surpassed, simulatees will experience the world at either a normal rate or a slower rate, as is chosen.

After this point, we expect foundation-shaking breakthroughs in all areas of technology at an unprecendented rate as simulatee scientists and engineers study and invent at a rate bounded only by the speed of the best computers. This self-feeding cycle is reminiscent of many projected singularity-class scenarios, where technology makes itself better and faster at making itself better and faster.

### Will Chain

Will Chain will be the crowdsource funding apparatus for the Afterlife Enterprise's endeavors. Will Chain is a blockchain which store's one's share in the Afterlife Enterprise. The idea is that these shares will persists after your physical body dies, so make sure to include us in your legal will! The blockchain entries will be signed using nuerological signature, a onetime-use cryptographic technique that insures that one's mind will recieve compensation for one's share in one's inevitable Afterlife™ (an afterlife also garunteed by one's share).

One's neurological specification creates a unique nuero-signature for signing a transaction onto Will Chain, and then when, and only when the reverse is accomplished will the same identity be rewarded with compensation for one's share's purchase in the form of Cerecredit tokens, a cryptocurrency blockchain  maintained in atomic parallel to Will Chain.

#### Neuro-Signature

One may encrypt data using their nuero-signature in any case that they may encrypt data with a normal cryptographic signature. A neuro-signature is unique in the way that it works, however. To create the encryption key, a uniquely specified (at the connectome level) and minor stimulus (input) is given to one's brain, and a uniquely specificied local of nuerological response (output) is recorded. The process by which the brain responds to the the input is an unsolved problem at the present time, and will only be possible to solve once the previously described simulation technology is accomplished. So, neuro-signatures are garunteed to be useless until that point, and are also garunteed to be impervious to tampering in the meantime. The prescribed utility of neuro-signatures are in securing shares on the Afterlife network. 

### Cerecredit (CC)

Cerecredit is a cryptocurrency for the Afterlife-powered Networld. It is currently envisioned to work life a modern contract-enabled cryptocurrency such as Ethereum, but with the speficic features purposely left modular for the time being. We expect much progress in the area of digital asset technology in the time before the first successful Afterlives, so we plan to incoperate the best results into our future cryptocurrency.

#### Minting
Cerecredit tokens will be minted with the first atomic activations by indetities from the Will Chain.
